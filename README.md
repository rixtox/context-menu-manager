# Context Menu Manager

A small utility to help me create customized context menus on Windows desktop and file explorer background. Mostly used
for "Open this folder in XXX..." cases.

See the `manifest.json` for example manu definitions. Nested menu structures are supported.

Use `${manifestFolder}` in any path string will interpolate with the directory containing the `manifest.json` file.

Still want more information? Read the code. It's not much.
